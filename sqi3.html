                    <p>I've compared other platforms to this one to be honest
                       and they don't measure up. The platforms that give a comparable
                        level of the quality of skills cost a lot more and don't even offer a
                         guarantee of access to real world project and situations... 
                         ones available at a cheaper price so to say do not give a level of 
                         quality even close to it... Some platforms charge a lot more
                        and yet still falter in the delivery of good contents...
                       Another aspect that I noticed in comparison 
                       is that instructors at SQI College of ICT are actually interested
                        in ensuring their students understand what they
                       are learning. They take joy in ensuring the students comprehend 
                       and are able to apply what is being taught and explain in the simplest ways
                       possible to ensure maximum comprehension....I'm not sharing
                     this because I have any affiliation with SQI College of ICT, 
                     I'm doing so because it's simply the truth. 
                      If anyone else tries to make their research, they will find out that it's true too.</p>

                   <p>SQI is one of the things I’m thankful for in my life.
                     I’ve spent six months in SQI and I can say it’s one of
                      the best moments in my life. The staffs are accommodating and 
                      very excellent at their job. The tutors don’t just teach, they 
                      mentor students. They make coding fun and understandable for learners.
                       I’m able to achieve a lot enrolling with them. I’ve been able to build 
                       amazing web projects under their tutelage. 
                    ENROLL WITH SQI AND YOU WILL BE PROUD YOU DID.</p>
